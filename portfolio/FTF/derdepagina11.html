                    <p>With a population of over 822,300, according to the Department for Research, Information and Statistics of the city of Amsterdam (www.ois. amsterdam.nl), Amsterdam is not only the capital city but also the most populous city in the Netherlands. Amsterdam is governed by an elected council that is seated in The Music Theatre/Stopera. The building houses both the city hall (stadhuis) and the Dutch Opera, hence the name Stopera. The mayor, appointed by the national government, has autonomous powers. The aldermen are elected by and from the city council. The decentralisation of the city’s administration in 1990 meant that many civic tasks and powers were delegated to the city districts. One aim of this operation was to increase public participation at local level, by enabling citizens to elect representatives to both their local district council and the city council. However, at the moment centralisation is gaining ground again.</p>

                    <p> Everybody aged fourteen and over must be able to show a valid identity card (ID) or passport if the police or anybody else with the authority such as conductors in public transport asks for it. They need to have a reason to ask for it, such as traf c control, aid and assistance, penal offences, or maintaining law and order. There will not be any special check-ups just to see if you have it on you. If you cannot show a valid identity card or passport on request, you can be taken to the police station where your identity will be checked. If you are sixteen or older, you will be ned €90 for not having your papers on you. Amsterdam is a great city to live in, but like any large city it has risks and dangers that you should be aware of.</p>
