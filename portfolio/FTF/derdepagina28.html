                    <p> If your study schedule allows it, you might be interested in nding a part-time job. While this can be a great experience, you are advised to first check with your host university for more information on work permits. Additional information can be found on the website of the Netherlands Organisation for International Cooperation in Higher Education (Nuffic), www.nuffic.nl.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> The Citizen Service Nummer (BSN) is a unique number for everybody who has to deal with the Dutch authorities. When in the Netherlands, you will automatically obtain a BSN if you register with the municipal authorities. To start your job you will need this number, so it is important to arrange this. To do this and also if you have other questions, you can go to the website www. burgerservicenummer.nl or contact your municipal authorities. It is, of course, also possible to go to the foreign studentsâ€™ counsellor. If you are planning to stay for only one semester you will not be able to get a job in the Netherlands, since it would take too much time to obtain the necessary documents.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> Ifyouare looking for a job, approach a job agency (uitzendbureau); they can be found all over town. They offer temporary jobs, also for students. If they do not have anything on offer, they will try to nd an appropriate job for you. Registration is free. For addresses look in the Gouden Gids (www.goudengids.nl). Look out for posters on shop windows or check the Internet. There is a maximum number of hours you are allowed to work as a non-EU student without a work permit. Do not exceed this, or the authorities will consider your residence permit invalid! For a student job you can also search the following websites:</p>

                        <li>www.undutchables.nl (also for information about work permits)</li>
                        <li>www.asastudent.nl (jobs of around fifteen hours a week for which you do not need to speak Dutch)</li>
