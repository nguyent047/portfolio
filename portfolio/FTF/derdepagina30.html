                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> There are two types of higher education institutions in the Netherlands, Universities and Universities of Applied Sciences (hogescholen or hbo). Hogescholen prepare students for specific professions and tend to be more practically oriented than universities, which focus more on theory and generating knowledge through research. Generally speaking, an hbo degree provides its graduates with suf cient skills and knowledge to practise the profession they were trained for, without any additional training.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> In the last decade, the system of higher education has been drastically reorganised to comply with the British or American model. This means that a university education has been subdivided into a broader, three-year bachelor’s degree and a one-year master’s degree. At hogescholen the bachelor’s degree takes four years while in some cases graduates will be able to continue their studies for one or two years for a master’s degree. The aim of this European reorganisation is to make the system of higher education more transparent throughout Europe and to make it easier to study in another country.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> All educational institutions try to provide all facilities necessary to enable their students to study to the best of their abilities. There are faculty libraries providing a quiet place for studying, computer rooms to work on papers and of course students can go to the departments with questions about the course programme or for help with a particular problem. If you are thinking about switching to another course, you could consult the student counsellor. Advice and information about course programmes is also available at the university information centre, where you can go with general questions or to make a personal appointment.</p>
