                    <p>Amsterdam has been called the city of 'gentle architecture', since its architectural charm lies not in its grandeur but in its intimate details. From the fifteenth century onwards, planning laws, plot sizes and the instability of the topsoil dictated that fa√ßades were largely uniform in size and were built of lightweight brick or sandstone. Large windows further reduced the weight of the buildings. For every new building, foundation pillars were driven deep into the soil to prevent sinking.

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p>The firstcanal houses (grachtenpanden), were single- storied, thatched wooden structures, with different oor levels at the front and back. Over time the front-side rooms were separated from the main room and the back of the house was similarly partitioned. The bedrooms were moved to the rst oor and goods were stored under the roof. Many seventeenth century canal houses are subsiding due to insuf cient foundations. In the past they were simply propped up by wooden supports, but these days technology allows for the replacement of rotten support piles without damaging the house.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p>The architectural style known as the Amsterdam School is one of the most characteristic Dutch styles. In the rst decades of the twentieth century, architects of the Amsterdam School designed several expressionistic, large-scale housing projects as well as public and private buildings. The architecture of the Amsterdam School is among the most renowned of early twentieth century styles. These buildings include the Scheepvaarthuis at the Prins Hendrikkade, Het Schip at the Hembrugstraat (it is a museum and well worth a visit!) and De Dageraad housing facility located at the Pieter Lodewijk Takstraat. The Amsterdam School style is not easily de ned because of the wide variety in forms on the one hand and the distinguishing features of the individual architects on the other.</p>

                    <p> The New Building architectural movement is a style of Dutch architecture from around 1915 to 1960. Its architects believed architecture was inextricably linked with the social situation in the country. They preferred functionality and lack of ornamentation and worked with modern materials like concrete, steel and glass as well as modern techniques and elementary geometric shapes.</p>
