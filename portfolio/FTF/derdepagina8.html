                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> On 11 November each year (mainly in the Northern provinces), children go from door to door with self-made lanterns, singing songs in exchange for sweets or fruit. The feast of Sint Maarten is based on a legend. Martinus (Maarten) was a Roman of cer born in Hungary in 316 AD. One cold day Maarten, then 15 years old, saw a poor man sitting in the snow without a coat. He got off his horse, cut his cloak in half with his sword and gave the poor man one half. Maarten died on 11 November 397 AD.</p>

                    <h3>Sinterklaas</h3>
                </header>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p>In spite of what everyone thinks, Sinterklaas (Saint Nicholas) does not come from Spain: he lived in Myra (present day Turkey) around 300 AD. As a bishop he helped the poor. When he died on 6 December 342 AD, he was declared a saint. The anniversary of his death became his name day, which people celebrate on its Eve. Sinterklaas is mainly a children’s holiday. On 5 December every year, also known as Pakjesavond, Sinterklaas brings gifts to all good children, together with his black helpers called Zwarte Pieten. They deliver gifts through the chimney. Special treats on 5 December are gingerbread biscuits (pepernoten), marzipan, chocolate letters and hot chocolate. Many Dutch students celebrate Sinterklaas with surprise presents. They write poems and hide their presents from each other in homemade contraptions. In November the arrival of Sinterklaas on his steam- boat is celebrated with a colourful parade. There is a continuing discussion in the Netherlands about whether or not the Zwarte Piet tradition holds a racist connotation, relating to the transatlantic slave trade in which Dutch seamen played an important role.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> The traditional way to celebrate a Dutch New Year’s Eve, 31 December, is to play games with family or friends, watch a special cabaret show on television and eat doughnut-like snacks made of fried, sweet dough known as oliebollen, appelbeignets (apple fritters) and appelflappen (apple turnovers). At midnight people go outside to wish everyone a Happy New Year, light reworks and drink champagne. Afterwards there are parties all over town.</p>

                    <p> During Carnival, 26 to 28 February 2017, people dress up in funny costumes, go to parties and drink a lot of alcohol. The regular order of things is turned upside down. Cities are renamed and ruled by Prince Carnival. Carnival is especially popular in the Southern and Eastern provinces of the Netherlands, particularly in the predominantly Catholic provinces of Limburg and Noord-Brabant.</p>
