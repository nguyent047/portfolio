                    <p>Amsterdam was built on the Amstel estuary, on what used to be marshland. To protect the town against the sea, a dam with a sluice gate was built in the river and the area was shielded by dikes, the Nieuwendijk and Zeedijk. This area formed the heart of what would ultimately become the city of Amsterdam. The city’s name was rst recorded in a document signed by the Dutch Count Floris V in 1275.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> From the year 1300, Amsterdam expanded rapidly thanks to a lively trade in spices, corn, sh and timber. Around 1500 Amsterdam had already become the largest city in the Netherlands. When Antwerp (the major trading port of the Low Countries) was taken by the Spaniards in 1585, Amsterdam took over its leading position, reaching the peak of its power and wealth in the seventeenth century. This period would become known as the Dutch Golden Age (Gouden Eeuw). In the eighteenth century the city gradually lost its hold on international trade to Great Britain. From 1795 to 1813 the Netherlands were occupied by the French, resulting in the further decline of the reputation of Amsterdam as an international trading port. From the 1850s onwards, however, Amsterdam’s economy recovered, partly due to the new Noordzeekanaal, the waterway connecting Amsterdam directly to the North Sea.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p>In the 1930s the country was hit by a recession that would last until after the Second World War. For many people this economic stagnation meant unemployment, poverty and misery. The German occupation (1940-1945) brought even more hardship. More than ten percent of the population of Amsterdam lost their lives during the occupation. Of the 80,000 Jewish people living in the city before the war, only 5,000 survived. The diary of the Jewish girl Anne Frank remains a powerful testimony to the fate of the Jewish people. After the war, the city’s economy flourished and Amsterdam became the cultural and intellectual centre of the country. In the rebel years of the 1960s, the Provo movement used provocations and non-conformist actions to rebel against the establishment. Many students defied university authorities and demanded democratic reforms. During the 1970s many people left Amsterdam to live in the countryside, which left some city districts under-populated and impoverished. However, in the last two decades, urban renewal schemes have been set up to counteract this problem, leading to a vibrant atmosphere in those city districts once again.</p>
