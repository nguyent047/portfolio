                    <p>The history of the Netherlands as a nation began in 1568. The province of Holland led the country into a war of independence against the Spanish Empire, in defence of religious and economic freedom. Independence was declared in 1581 and in 1648 the nation gained international recognition as the Republic of the United Provinces of the Netherlands. In 1813, after the French occupation, the Netherlands became a unified state and a constitutional monarchy under King William I of Orange.</p>

                    <p> Since the Netherlands became a monarchy in 1813, the country has been ruled by the House of Orange. Today the reigning head of state is King Willem-Alexander. His eldest daughter, Princess Amalia, is heir to the throne. The Dutch constitution states that the monarch has immunity and that the ministers are responsible for governing the country.</p>

                    <p>There are various political parties represented in the Dutch Parliament, usually more than ten. The two major parties of the last decades have been the PvdA (Social Democrats) and the VVD (Liberal Democrats). At least every four years there are democratic elections, after which a coalition government is formed. Most of the time the prime minister is found in the largest government party of the coalition. In fact, this has been the case since 1973. However, this is not an official rule.</p>
