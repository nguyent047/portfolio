                    <p> For such a small country, the Netherlands has many newspapers. There are ten national and dozens of regional newspapers. There are also many magazines and radio and television broadcasting stations. Many Dutch people subscribe to one or more newspapers and get them delivered to their home. The national newspapers are de Volkskrant, Trouw, Algemeen Dagblad, De Telegraaf, NRC Handelsblad, Het Financieele Dagblad, Het Parool, Nederlands Dagblad and Reformatorisch Dagblad. De Telegraaf is the nearest thing to a tabloid, the rest are seen as quality newspapers. Het Parool focusses on Amsterdam. Nederlands Dagblad and Reformatorisch Dagblad are Protestant newspapers. Also, there is a free daily newspaper: Metro. It is distributed for free at train and metro stations.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> Dutch television has three public channels, with the broadcasting time divided among twelve broadcasting associations, each acting from a particular philosophy. The diversity of Dutch television is ensured by the Broadcasting Act. In the last two decades the public channels have had to compete with an increasing number of commercial networks. Both public and commercial channels broadcast a large number of lms and series in English, with Dutch subtitles. Amsterdam and the surrounding areas are served by two local (Dutch only) networks, AT5 and NH. Foreign networks take up the other available television channels, so you might nd broadcasts in your native language easily.</p>
