                    <h3>The Family Doctor or General Practitioner (GP)</h3>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p>The family doctor or general practitioner (huisarts) plays a key role in the Dutch health care system. Your GP is usually the rst person you go to with any medical problem, so it is best to register with one as soon as you are more or less settled in. If you are studying at the University of Amsterdam or the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, the secretarial of ce of your university can usually refer you to the Bureau Studentenartsen (student doctors). These doctors function as GPs, but have specific expertise in student health matters. If you live in Amsterdam, you can register with them for free. Be sure to take your insurance card with you to your rst appointment. If you are a student at the Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten (AHK), you can contact your student counsellor to help you see a GP. Some GPs have open consultation hours. If you would like to visit outside these hours, then you should call your own GP for an appointment.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> Once you are in the Netherlands you can register with the GP Of ce. Call the of ce on 020 444 14 00, daily between 08.00 to 12.00 hrs to make an appointment for registration. For this appointment, you will need to bring a valid identi cation document, such as your passport, a valid proof of insurance and your medical record. After completion of your registration you can make use of the GPs in the of ce. Currently there are eight practitioners working in the of ce. Make an appointment to visit one.</p>

                </header>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> If a medical problem requires specialist treatment, the family doctor can refer you to a specialist, who will report back to him or her about their findings and proposed treatment. Both family doctors and specialists are bound by a confidentiality agreement, which means they are not allowed to discuss anything related to your case with anyone else without your permission. If you do not yet have a GP and need medical assistance, you can always call the Stichting Huisartsen Dienstposten Amsterdam (General Medical Services) on 020 344 53 77 where you will be put through to the doctor in attendance. Or go to www.huisartsenpostenamsterdam.nl. In some cases you have to pay for consultations and prescriptions yourself before you send the bill on to your insurance company for a refund. In other cases the bill is sent on directly.</p>
