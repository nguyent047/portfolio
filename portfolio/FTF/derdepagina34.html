                    <p> Hogescholen and universities have clubs to keep students informed about course schedules and related subjects and to represent the students in decisions regarding the programme. Parties, trips and other social activities are sometimes part of the programme as well.</p>

                    <p> To get to know people outside your own institute or field, you can join one of Amsterdam’s student organisations. These organise all kinds of activities, ranging from lectures and plays to parties. For most organisations, membership is required. The UvA together with the Hogeschool van Amsterdam (HvA) has a similar society for foreign students, called the International Student Network Amsterdam (ISN). The ESN section for Inholland University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam/Diemen is called ESN Diemen. They will make you feel more at home in the Netherlands and help you make new friends. The general student union is the ASVA. This organisation represents students’ interests at universities, hogescholen and in the political arena. They also organise courses, political debates and much more. You can always contact ASVA if you want to become an active member of the student union. For homosexual, bisexual and transgender students, A.S.V.Gay organises meetings and can serve as a safe space.</p>

                    <p> ASDV Bonaparte is a student debating society that meets on Thursday nights between 20.00 to 01.00 hrs. If you would like them to organise an English language evening for you, send them an e-mail. Some universities have their own cafés, like Fest at Amstelcampus or the HES (Hogeschool voor Economische Studies) Café. These cafés have a great atmosphere and are good places to meet fellow students. Another reason to go there is the fact that they are usually not expensive.</p>
