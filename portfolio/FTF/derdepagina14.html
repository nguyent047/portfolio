                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p>In the 1960s, the time of the Teddy Boys (nozems) and hippies, Leidseplein was the coolest place to hang out. Nowadays the area is very tourist orientated and seems to be lled with snack bars, travel agencies and currency exchange of ces. The square itself is pleasant enough, with its rows of bars on three sides and a large, shaded terrace in the middle. In the summer months the square comes alive with street performers, musicians, jugglers, re-eaters and percussionists.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> Dam Square was the favourite hippie hang-out in the 1960s, the place where they met and smoked joints. Some even slept there. Nowadays, mainly tourists visit Dam Square, as it is the first large square you come across if you follow the Damrak into the city from Centraal Station. On the West-hand side of the square you see the old City Hall, dating from the seventeenth century. It has been a Royal Palace since 1830, used mainly for formal receptions. The Royal Palace has recently been renovated. On the corner of Dam Square and Damrak you find de Bijenkorf (a high-class department store). The opposite corner of the square leads off into the Kalverstraat (the city’s main shopping street). In the middle of Dam Square you find the Dam Monument, where every year on 4 May the Dutch commemorate war victims who died since the start of the Second World War.</p>
