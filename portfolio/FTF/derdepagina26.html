                    <p>In Amsterdam there are two agencies that are run on a non-commercial basis: ASVA and SRVU, both mentioned above. All the other agencies in the city are run on a commercial basis, which means that they want to earn a profit. All commercial agencies offering houses or rooms must be registered with the Amsterdam authorities. Check the Wijksteunpunt Wonen at www.wswonen.nl/english if you have questions. Agencies are allowed to ask for a registration fee. They will offer you a house or room within four months and if they are unable to do so, you can get your money back. If they do find you a room, you have to pay for their services. We advise you to be careful when you apply to a room agency. Go to the ASW of ce (www.huurders.info) for information and advice.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> If you do not need a bike regularly, you can also rent one. In the address section we have listed a couple of places. You will have to pay a deposit to take a bike out, but some shops accept your passport and credit card instead of cash. The cheapest day rate is around €9.50; the deposit can be anything from €50, a passport, identity papers or credit card. Many Dutch bikes brake by back-pedalling. This can take some time to get used to, so if you prefer handbrakes, ask for a bike with hand- brakes. Students can also rent a bike for a special student rate at Rent-a-bike.</p>
