                    <p>The Netherlands has a population of around seventeen million people. By car it will take you only four hours to drive from North to South. The country is bordered by Belgium, Germany and the North Sea. Amsterdam is the capital city of the Netherlands, but the seat of government is in Den Haag (The Hague).</p>

                    <p> The Western and Northern parts of the country lie between one and six metres below sea level. The soil here is mostly peat and clay, cut through with canals, rivers and estuaries. Much of the land is used for farming or grazing. The territories below sea level used to be lakes or belong to the sea. Mills and pumping stations are used to drain them. The pumping stations run constantly to prevent ooding. Furthermore, the coastal areas are protected by natural dunes as well as by manmade dikes. The Flevopolder and the Noordoostpolder are the two polders reclaimed from the sea in the neverending battle against the water. After the reclamation the land was divided into lots. In 1953, the southern province of Zeeland was hit by a disastrous ood. In the decades following this ood the Delta Works were constructed to straighten and strengthen the southern shoreline with new dikes, dams, sluices and bridges.</p>
