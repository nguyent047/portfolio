                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p>Most people celebrate Christmas with their family by having a Christmas tree and a luxurious dinner. A lot of churches have special Christmas services. In recent years more and more people have adopted the Anglo-American tradition of exchanging Christmas presents, making the Kerstman (Santa Claus) a friendly rival to Sinterklaas. However, not many people know that the Kerstman was based on Sinterklaas. Christmas is celebrated on 25 and 26 December.</p>

The King and members of the Royal Family pay a public visit to one or two cities. All over the country, people participate in street markets much like yard sales and perform or play games in the streets. There are food and drink stalls and concerts in every town in the Netherlands. Most people wear orange, the royal colour. The night before King’s Day, Koningsnacht, almost everybody goes out. There are many special parties, although you will have to buy tickets in advance because usually these are in high demand.</p>
