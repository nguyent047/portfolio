                    <p> For photocopying, you can use the machines at your faculty or those in libraries, shops and supermarkets. At commercial copy centres you can also have your papers printed and bound. One of these is Lowie Kopie copy centres, which has four shops where you can print, bind, copy and make your own business cards. You can also send them your work online and pick it up later. See under addresses for the nearest Lowie Kopie Copy Centre.</p>
