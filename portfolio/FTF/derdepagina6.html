                    <p>For centuries the Netherlands has maintained a policy of freedom of religion. As a result the country has always been home to many religious groups. Generally speaking, the Southern provinces tend to be Roman Catholic, while the Northern provinces are mainly Protestant. The Protestant Church of the Netherlands (Protestantse Kerk Nederland or PKN) comprises nearly all Protestant communities with a few independent splinter factions here and there. Various smaller religious groups complete the complex religious picture. Together with student unions, churches and other organisations, the Student Parish VE90 arranges debates, events, trips and gatherings for students aged eighteen to thirty. The Student Parish is also available for confidential consultations. There is one student chaplain for international students, with consultations in English. Their origin is Christian, but they welcome students from any religious background. One notable feature of the Netherlands is that 44 percent of Dutch people are not religious. Catholics make up 28 percent of the population. The Protestant faiths account for a further eighteen percent, while ve percent are Islamic and ve percent have other faiths.</p>
