                    <h3>Bicycles</h3>
                </header>
                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p>Amsterdam is full of bicycles. The Dutch are true bike fanatics; practically everyone has one or more bicycles and there are lanes everywhere. These separate bicycle lanes, together with separate cyclists’ traffic lights are meant to make the roads safer for cyclists. The most enjoyable way to discover Amsterdam is by bike. On a bike you can go to places where no cars are allowed and buses and trams cannot take you. Any bike will do in Amsterdam – as long as it gets you from A to B, it does not matter what shape it is in. However, the brakes and the lights must work or you risk getting a ne. The AFAC (Amsterdam Fiets Afhandel Centrale) collects all the bikes that have been removed by the authorities or have been found. In the locker bike sheds you can park your bike and have it guarded for free for the rst 24 hours. After that you pay €0.50 for the second and for the third day. If you want to park your bike even longer, you must pay €2 a day. For more information and locations, go to www.locker.amsterdam.nl (Dutch only). You can buy second-hand bicycles at most bicycle repair shops. A second option is putting up an advertisement on the notice board of your local supermarket or library. On www. marktplaats.nl there are many bikes for sale. Do not buy bikes from strangers in the street – chances are that it has been stolen, which means you risk being arrested or having to pay a €160 fine. You might even get a criminal record if the theft was reported. Members of the ASVA student union can buy second-hand bikes for €60 plus €15 membership, every Thursday. However, you get the bicycle without a lock. For details, go to www.asva.nl.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> Bicycle thieves are everywhere, so it is essential to secure your bike. Fasten both the front wheel and frame to a stand post or railing using a strong lock. For advice on how to keep your bike safe from thieves, ask the rental companies or specialist bike shops which you can nd at the end of the chapter. You can buy good and cheap locks at the Waterlooplein market, as well as in bicycle (repair) shops.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> If you do not need a bike regularly, you can also rent one. In the address section we have listed a couple of places. You will have to pay a deposit to take a bike out, but some shops accept your passport and credit card instead of cash. The cheapest day rate is around €9.50; the deposit can be anything from €50, a passport, identity papers or credit card. Many Dutch bikes brake by back-pedalling. This can take some time to get used to, so if you prefer handbrakes, ask for a bike with hand- brakes. Students can also rent a bike for a special student rate at Rent-a-bike.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> If you feel like cycling, hire an OV bicycle. You can hire one at most stations and return it to many other locations. Look for locations at www. ov- ets.nl. You can also subscribe via this site. To hire a bicycle you need to subscribe and possess an OV-chipkaart.</p>

                </header>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p>When driving through the city, watch out for trams and cyclists. Trams always have right of way and cyclists usually take it. Take care especially when turning and give way to cyclists. Many Amsterdammers, whether they are pedestrians, cyclists or drivers, do not follow the traf c rules. So please be careful and do not take any risks. Most of the city centre is one-way only; when driving along canals make sure you always stay to the right of the canal. Diamond-shaped signs with a yellow centre indicate you have right of way; in all other cases, yield to traf c from the right. The worst thing about driving in the city is nding a place to park. If you park where parking is forbidden, or if you forget to pay your parking fee, the traf c warden will give you a ne and put a wheel clamp on your wheel, or even tow away your car. If your car has been towed away, it will take a phone call to the traffic warden’s of ce and a large sum of money to get it back.</p>

                    <p> Behind Amsterdam Centraal Station, free ferry services connect the city centre to Amsterdam Noord across the IJ. Apart from the ferries there is also a waterbus to the Java-eiland. Ferries depart more frequently during peak hours.</p>

                </header>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> If your driving licence was issued in a EU country, it is valid in the Netherlands for one year, provided you drive a foreign car. After this year, or if you want to drive a Dutch car, you need to apply for a Dutch driving licence. It will take about a month for the application to be processed. Non-EU nationals need an international licence in addition to their regular licence. This international licence, for which you have to apply in your country of origin, is valid until your tourist visa expires. After that it has to be exchanged for a Dutch driving licence. This procedure takes about three months. If you do not have a driving licence yet, you could try to get one in the Netherlands. However, taking lessons and applying for a driving test can take a lot of time and money. If you have any questions about this, please contact the Department of Transport (Rijksdienst voor het Wegverkeer).</p>
