                    <p> International Student Network (ISN) Amsterdam is a student-run organisation dedicated to help international students studying at the UvA and the HvA in making the most of their stay in the Netherlands. ISN is part of the Erasmus Student Network (ESN), an organisation with 505 local sections in 38 countries. They are here to ensure that you are going to have the time of your life studying abroad. ISN achieves this by organising great introduction days, parties, weekend trips, excursions and other cultural activities. This dynamic organisation promotes integration through the Dutch coaches who guide international students during the introduction period, as well as a sophisticated buddy system. Some classic examples of ISN activities include the Discover Holland weekend, Dutch movie nights, Dutch lessons and daytrips to the places in the Netherlands you must not miss. In addition to this, ISN even organises a number of international trips to popular European destinations such as Prague, Paris and London. With an ESN card you can join all the ISN activities. In addition to this, this card provides you with various great discounts at their weekly borrel (drinks) and lots of museums, shops and restaurants.
