                    <p>Dutch law makes a distinction between two categories of drugs, soft drugs and hard drugs. Hash and weed (marijuana) fall into the soft drugs category. Hard drugs are all the other kinds of drugs. Hard drugs are highly addictive and can cause serious harm if misused. This is why they are illegal and forbidden. Soft drugs, on the other hand, are tolerated if you have less than five grams. Below you will find some rules concerning the regulation, use and sale of drugs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is illegal to have hard drugs in your possession, to sell them or to use them</li>
                        <li>It is illegal to have over ve grams of soft drugs in your possession</li>
                        <li>The use or possession of soft drugs is illegal for anyone aged under eighteen</li>
                        <li>It is illegal to promote or advertise for the use or sale of soft drugs</li>
                        <li>Anyone causing trouble when under the in uence of drugs can be charged with disturbing the peace</li>

                    <p> However socially acceptable, to a certain extent alcohol is just as addictive as drugs and is just as dangerous. Keep in mind that it is illegal to drink and drive and that the same applies to riding a bicycle. Take note that drinking in public is prohibited as well. On page 67 you will nd some organisations that provide information about the use of drugs and alcohol.</p>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p> In most Dutch coffeeshops, coffee is not actually the main item on the menu; soft drugs are. Trustworthy coffeeshops are identified by a green and white window sticker and the word ‘coffeeshop’. If you want coffee, go to a café or bar.</p>

                    <p>There are two types of cannabis products, hash and weed. Weed is a powder, ground from the tips of the leaves of the hemp plant. In order to make hash, this powder is sieved and compressed afterwards. Both substances are usually rolled into cigarettes. For some people, cannabis can cause depression or panic attacks.</p>

                    <p> Cocaine is a powerful drug and it is mainly taken by snif ng the white crystalline powder through the nose. It causes a relatively short- lived sensation of euphoria. Its negative effects are mostly psychological; cocaine can cause memory loss, apathy, depression, paranoia and hallucinations. GHB, a substance that has become known as a ‘date-rape drug’, affects the central nervous system. It causes the body temperature to drop, lowers the heart rate and slows the breathing. Because GHB is absorbed into the system very quickly, its effects are immediate and very unpredictable. Whenconsumedinlargequantities, GHB can even cause convulsions. LSD is a strong hallucinatory drug, working on the central nervous system. It is not addictive, but is best avoided because of its unpredictable effects. The use of LSD can cause acute panic attacks, hallucinations, psychoses and delusions. Opiates are derived from opium, which is one of the most addictive drugs. It comes in grains or in black, gum-like slices and can be eaten, smoked or injected. Opiates strongly affect the nervous system and are highly addictive; users have to keep increasing the dosage to get the same effect. An example of an opiate is heroin. XTC has a stimulating and psychotomimetic effect. It causes the body to overheat, which can cause damage to the heart and liver. Even small quantities of XTC can cause a ‘bad trip’, including ashbacks, anxiety or panic attacks and psychotic episodes.</p>

                    <h3>Smart Drugs</h3>
                </header>

                <div class="uitklap">
                    <p>Smartdrug is a term used for certain stimulants used to boost memory, concentration or brainpower. Some of these substances are also used in medications for dementia, amnesia and epilepsy. The Dutch term paddo is used for any mushroom with a hallucinatory effect. The concentration and the effect of the active substance vary according to the type of mushroom used, as well as according to the way it is digested. Many magic mushrooms resemble LSD in their effects and like LSD, they can cause delusions and psychotic episodes. In a reaction to a number of incidents involving magic mushrooms, the Dutch government classed all types of magic mushrooms as hard drugs. This means that the sale of paddos is illegal in the Netherlands.</p>
